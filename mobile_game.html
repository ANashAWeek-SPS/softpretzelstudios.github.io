        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p><strong>Project NES</strong> is a homebrew NES game to represent the beginning of our studio! It is a lot harder than thought before though!</p>
        
        <h3>Game Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Puzzle Escape</li>
            <li><strong>Platform:</strong> The NES and it's emulators</li>
            <li><strong>Core Mechanics:</strong> turn-based escape with enemies trying to gun you down.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Levels:</strong> Designed for short bursts of gameplay (5 min per level). Something to pick up and get instantly, play then leave.</li>
            <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Going for gruff and badassery with the manual coming with the badass models I'm going for these characters</li>
            <li><strong>Character:</strong> You play as Vicky, who is in a mafia filled town, and as a rival boss she has to escape before they get to her.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Inspirations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fire Emblem and an Itch.io game in the credits</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>Mostly just for new Soft Pretzel Studio fans to play some older games. also for anyone who may enjoy homebrew NES titles before we move on to the SNES</p>

        <h3>Development Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Engine:</strong> TBD</li>
            <li><strong>Art:</strong> TBD</li>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> TBD</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progression</h3>
        <p>Players will progress through levels by escaping working on something like a house structure. level 1 is top floor and etc.</p>

        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
        <p>Post-launch plans are playing it on official hardware. That will be an insane video</p>
