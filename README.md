# Soft Pretzel Studios

Welcome to the temporary GitHub Pages site for **Soft Pretzel Studios**, the Entertainment Studio founded by Nashiem. This site is currently under development and serves as a placeholder to share our current projects, updates, and future plans.

## About Soft Pretzel Studios

Soft Pretzel Studios is an independent game development first studio based in Richmond, VA. The goal is to eventually expand to include a variety of creative projects, including comics, books, movies, TCG, and other cool projects like a browser and some OS's. 

### Current Focus

- **Game Development**: Currently working on a NES Game that I'm documenting on youtube
- **Youtube Plans**: Putting a whole range of content like my game dev, commentary and essays on gaming, tech projects, and even a sports league for amiibos.
- **Future Projects**: Planning future projects on our discord!

## Website Overview

This GitHub Pages site provides a brief overview of Soft Pretzel Studios, including:

- **About US**: Information about Soft Pretzel Studios
- **Projects**: Details on current and upcoming projects.
- **Updates**: News and updates regarding the studio.

### Note

This site is temporary and will be replaced with a more comprehensive website in the future as projects progress and the studio grows. The current site is intended to establish an online presence and engage with the community during the early stages of development. Most discussion will be on our discord though

## Contributing

As a solo developer, I am always looking for collaborators. Soft Pretzel Studios budget is a lovely $0 so dont expect much XD. I want to pay people fairly so I will not be hiring anyone. Donations in ways of money or otherwise is always greatly appreciated. In the midst of setting up my Ko-fi and Patreon

## Future Plans

- **What's going on in the future?**: SPS is defenitely in a very rough patch right now. My (Nashiem) home-life isnt stable so I really work on SPS when I can as much as I can.

Thank you for visiting Soft Pretzel Studios' GitHub Pages site. Stay tuned for exciting updates!

## Disclaimer

I did use ChatGPT to write most of this site to save on some time so a few links and services like the mailing list isnt fully functional yet. Bare with us!
